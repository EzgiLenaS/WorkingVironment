On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 02/05/2020 ~
I tried to setup Netbeans properly and explore its components

### ~ 03/05/2020 ~
I helped our group in brainstorming about what classes we need, which parts of our project can be considered as objects, since we will try to do this project in OOP... And We split some  of the work load in order to quicken our progress, I am going to work on GUI with some of my friends for now.

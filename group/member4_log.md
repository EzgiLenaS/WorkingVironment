On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ 02/05/2020 ~
I tried to setup Netbeans properly and explore its components

### ~ 03/05/2020 ~
I helped our group in brainstorming about what classes we need, which parts of our project can be considered as objects, since we will try to do this project in OOP... And We split some  of the work load in order to quicken our progress, I am going to work on GUI with some of my friends for now.

### ~ 7-14 May 2020 ~
I tried to work with Scene builder a bit. I explored different classes that can be useful in our GUI as parallel to my friends suggestions like ListViewer class. I and Ezgi Lena, decided on newest iterations to our part, having edit button on links and making them selectable for multiple deletion and deleting all links from a box. Furthermore, we are most likely finalising the design with ListViewer class on the links. In the Links they can have names for easy remembering, and edit button will provide changes. More work on our part in GUI in progress...

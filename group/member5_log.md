On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

I did some research on web and our textbook about how databases work and how databases are created as it might be essential for our project to store the links of apps.

I tested the classes YiÄŸit created as templates to see whether they worked properly on Windows. I observed that if the target location of the application is locked, using appName.exe as the string on getDesktop().open(new File(String title)). I also tested getDesktop().browse(new URI(String title)) to open website URLs and it worked for all links that start with "https://" but not for the links that start with "ftp://".

### ~ 03 May 2020 ~

After deciding to use Serializable class instead of using databases to store links, I did research on the Serializable class and how it proceeds.

Berkan found another method to open applications or executable files directly by selecting the file from its location. I tested it to see whether it worked for all type of files and the method worked.

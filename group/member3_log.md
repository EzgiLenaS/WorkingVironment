On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ date ~ 25 and 26 April 2020
- This weekend I looked for how to browse a website using java
- I come up with multiple solutions and tried all of it give them some test to see if they actually work 
- most of them didn't even open html pages so there were actually 2 possible solutions to actually browsing through java
- but considering that we will need some input from the user and as user are prone to give unsatisfactory input I am thinking of using Desktop class (will ask the group next week)
- I also looked at how can we open external programs by using java (the easiest one for the user would be Runtime class in my opinion)
- However, runtime class works perfectly for windows but does not even work for mac (maybe it is due to my unsatisfactory input?? look into it deeply next week)
- Looked for how to use Serializable interface efficiently so that our program can actually store links or directories
- Worked on a Serializable and actually made it work by implementing a quick Person class ( Looking forward to actually using it for my project)
- need a file to use Serializable? (if not how? look into it) if we need, how to store it in our application ( maybe bring the java code and the file in a folder and use .zip?)

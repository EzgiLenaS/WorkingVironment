On this page I will keep a weekly record of what I have done for the CS102 group project. 
This page will be submitted together with the rest of the repository, in partial fulfillment of the CS102 course requirements.

### ~ date ~ 30 April 2020
Today I tried to learn how JavaFx works because I thought that maybe we can design our project with that instead of swing

### ~ date ~ 01 May 2020
I have been trying to deal with javaFx tutorials for project 

### ~ date ~ 03 May 2020 
Today we met in zoom with all group and Berkan shows us the FileChooser class and how can it be used in our project
I do not remember which they I drow the symbol but we decided to the symbol for our project 
I inspired from the wolkvagen's symbol and created it 
also Berkan gives an idea for the green letter V which has a white part in it like whatsapp "seen" symbol

### ~ date ~ 07.05.2020 ~
This week we decided to use javaFxscene builder and 
then Berkan found listView class for adding boxes in a list and adding links in to box lists for each box

### ~ date ~ 10 May 2020 ~
Today we had a little meeting with Mert
and try to decide what can we show the names of links on the 
Manage Screen page which comes after clicking the "manage" button one of the boxes
First we decided to show the links on list view as Berkan, Saitcan, and Osman do
then we decied to out the necessary buttons in a VBox
I learned observable list and its function thanks to Berkan

### ~ date ~ 11 May 2020 ~
Today TableView is decided for showing the names of links instead of list view 
because it seemed more easier to do for me. Maybe they are the same thing according 
to their functions and methods but I liked tableview (:

### ~ date ~ 15.05.2020 ~
Today I watched some videos for JavaFX tutorial from TheNewBoston youtube channel,
and he is the number one to teach an information to me.
At the beginning I tried to do the project on the scene builder but I was trying to write the necessary codes 
in the main class but not in the controller. I thought that it is just a name changing
and I can compile the code with the .fxml but nooooo!! I couldn't achieve it then started to code by hand as Berkan, Saitcan, and Osman

**update and footnote: With this day we had been always in a connection with Berkan and he helped as much as possible,
If you read one day, this log, again and again thank you so much (:

### ~ date ~ 16.05.2020 ~
Today I watched again the newboston channel and created two classes for 
trying to whether the table view show the string on it with observable list or not 
Yes it worked then I put the buttons on the right side of the panel

### ~ date ~ 17.05.2020 ~
We met with Mert on Discord and discussed the last situation of the code
Now The links can be seen on the tableview but still I couldnt integrate the Yiğit and Arda's code for our class
Late time of the night...
I tried to connect the Box class with the ManageScreenPanel class with taking 
some help from one the group members Berkan and also one of my friend İsmet.
At the begining we thought that we should create a pop up for asking 
web or app link to user but we decided to do this in ManageScreenPanel

### ~ date ~ 18.05.2020 ~
Today I managed to connect the getlinks method with the Box class's arraylist<shortcut>.
And also come together with Berkan and Osman (and sometimes Saitcan) on the discord 
and discussed the last situation of the project

**And I met with a person who is graduated from our school right now, and asked some questions to him also 
Thank you so much Barış bro :) to decrease my stress and for enlightening me :) 

In addtion, I coded the addbutton methos for webpages and connected this method 
with one of the class which is called Box from Yiğit and Arda

### ~ date ~ 19.05.2020 ~
We were in Zoom all day with Osman, Berkan, Saitcan and tried to finish the job
and sometimes Mert also was with us
I coded the addbutton method for apppages according to instructions 
from Berkan who learned the filechooser class at the begining and this class made our job easier

Then Mert came and five of us tried to link their page and added buttons for transitions
We combined 2 GUI parts and made everything working but reading the neccessary information from a text file
After that I attended the final Zoom meeting 
by the way Osman made the last touch for controlling whether the project works or not and we finished it 
:) Thank you osman

### ~ date ~ 20.05.2020 ~
Today we met on Zoom and record the video 
And I wanted to edit the video and my friends let me to do it 
I hope it looks nice (:
Now we are happy what we did 
We still think that yes we would do better than this but... yes we are happy right now (:
And thank you sooo much to my group friends for their exortion (:

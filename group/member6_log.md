### ~ 10.05.2020 ~
Today we had a little meeting with Berkan and Sait Can 
We tried to go as much as we can in 3 hours
First we handled the all the parts but Listview of Boxes
We placed our logo and delete, deleteall and add buttons 
Then we looked and figured out how to select items from Listview 
We find how to edit String items and still trying to do it for objects
We looked at Observablelist, objectproperty, selection model and Multiple selection classes
None of them solved our problem but we are still searching...

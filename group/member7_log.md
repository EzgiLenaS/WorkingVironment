There is a problem that synchronyzing the BoxViews and Box objects.
#15.05.2020 16.30 - 21.30
i tried to add actionlistener to some nodes from a different class which they are not initalised in to change scenes in MainScreen class
total failure!!!!
#16.05.2020 12.00- 16.30
I tried to come with a solution to delete Box object in profile object's boxes arraylist
it turned out that we need to take the selected boxview objects into box arraylist
to remove from profile.Boxes arraylist. We used a for loop that does this task.

Osman Saitcan and i tried to come up with a solution to change the scene
in main method from another class' action listener.
As a solution we made possible scene objects in MainScreen class static
and added get methods to that class to change them in other classes.
#17.05.2020 12.00 - 14.30
Osman Lena and me finally compiled and run the final form 
the code didn't do what we expected at first but we realised that there are  some problems
we repackeced the project and clean the build directory and it was solved.

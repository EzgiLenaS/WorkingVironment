G2B - CS102 Project 
WorkingVironment


##Reflections 
- We worked as a team for the first time which was hard.
- We realised that we can learn lots of thing independently.
- Organising in group was hard so as a solution we divided group in to 3 teams to be more agile.
- There were no consensus at some parts of the project continued for a time which stoped us 
  for devoloping our project more.
- We put more effort on designening properly even our UI.
- We would work more

G2B - CS102 Group Project - WorkingVironment

## Project Description
This project is designed for user to create shortcuts 
and open many external programs on one's desktop or 
browse many webpages at the same time with one click. 

## Instructions for oppening project sourcecode
- First JDK 8 or higher should be installed already.
- Go to WorkingVironment.workingNvironment.GUI Hierarchy.workingvironment directory 
and open the MainScreen.drjava with Drjava.(Compiler version must be 1.8.242).
- One can also laucnh the WorkingVironment.jar file.


## Project Status
- Core functionalaty of the program works perfect, 
a user can open files and links simultaneously without any problem.
- Application's status is saved via java Serializable interface 
in a textfile with application's current root.
- User can't see the name changes of a box immediatly.
One needs to close and reopen the application to see the name changes.

## What remains to be done
- Updating the box name could have been improved.
- Location of the user data file could be better(User being able to choose the root would have been nice.).

i did manage screen, other manage screen panels and other gui like fileorlink main screen panel i helped my groupmates Berkan and Osman.
In the manage screen, we are inputting and outputting files with serializable class, we are adding elements to our view, we are setting our scenes and their attributes.
I used getter classes and static scene and windows variables to reach them in a different class otherwise reaching them will be very hard.
I used action listener to changing scenes( a mouse listener).
